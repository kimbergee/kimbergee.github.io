description: This version of Kioku is built from scratch with Ruby on Rails. It is a self-destructing to-do list. This utility application uses rake automation to remove to-do items that are over 7 days old. The logic is that if the task has not been completed in a week, it is not important enough to be on a to-do list. The intention is to motivate users to complete their tasks ASAP and keep their lists up-to-date and relevant.
tools: jQuery, AJAX, HTML/CSS/SASS, Bootstrap, Devise library for user authentication, SQLite3 for development and PostgreSQL for production
